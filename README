This is my capstone project for my Masters in Data Science at Eastern University.  
To read a summary of the project, view graphs, and explore the model by entering your own values, visit my website https://rebeccaveng.pythonanywhere.com

The purpose of this project was to determine whether or not including paternal demographic features would improve the predictive ability of a MultiOutputClassifier
RandomForestClassifier model and a MultiOutputRegressor RandomForestRegressor model when compared to models using maternal demographic features.
